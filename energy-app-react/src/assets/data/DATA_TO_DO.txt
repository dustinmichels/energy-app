ISSUES TO WRESTLE WITH:

• Can’t get more than 1 year’s-worth of data at a time from the Carleton database (at least not with the API call we’ve been using). Currently the “yearly” data are hard-coded sums; we’ll want to replace these with a routine that actually makes the API query and sums the REAL data that come back.

• We’ll need to retrieve buildingIDs (for the url API query) from the database itself rather than assuming Burton is (and will always be) buildingID 23, for example.

• Building names in database aren’t the exact same as the are in the app — we’ll want a more robust (non-hardcoded) way of translating (see example names below)

• The “real data” version (on the “feature/api” branch) currently only uses BURTON data (buildingID = 23). It’ll be simple enough to replace the hard-coded “23” with the proper buildingIDs for each building, BUT not every building’s utility usage can be summarized by just ONE building ID:

	const buildingIDs = {

• The way we’re currently pulling “real” data from the database is dumb — there’s a lot of unnecessarily-repeated code in “sumDaysToWeeks” and “sumDaysToMonths” (sorry; it was a quick fix).
